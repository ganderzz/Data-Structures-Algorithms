A repo for me to practice Computer Science concepts while learning C++. Feel free to open an issue if you have tips on how to improve the code!


### How to Compile

I'm using the [Buck](https://buckbuild.com/) build tools to compile the project.

```
buck run :linkedlist
```

Will build the linked list portion of the project. Different build targets, prefixed by `:[target]` can be found in the *BUCK* file.
